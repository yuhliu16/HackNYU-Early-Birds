## Inspiration
We are late starters in career planning. Long before our graduate programs, we spent most of our undergrad time learning, exploring, and then forgetting knowledge. We have deeply felt the feeling of confusion, overwhelm, and lack of career advice before graduating from undergraduate school, so we want to build a clear bridge between knowledge and industry experience for others who are learning new things. Let more students learn the application of professional knowledge from shallow to deep step by step.

## What it does
The Early Birds contains courses, projects, and internships with each required skill being classified into 5 levels, and it creates a personal profile based on skills and related skill levels. Then, users can only take courses and projects that have lower-level requirements to upgrade their skill levels unless they take self-assessment tests to unlock the skip current level. In another word, users need to take courses and projects within a given order unless they pass the self-assessment tests. 

In addition, upon applying for internships from our platform, users can read the skill set suitability and provide skill level certifications to employers. Early Birds can help users locate themselves among skill levels and even start learning a tool with clear directions and no previous experience.

## How we built it
We used Figma for prototyping and content design. Bootstrap for creating HTML templates. And finally, integrated into Django and connected to backends.

## Challenges we ran into
We had limited time and hands but a lot of pages. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even though the task was heavy, we finished all the sample pages and integrated the pages into Django. This is the first time we built a project from nothing in 2 days.

## What we learned
We learned Figma and enhanced our knowledge with BootStrap, but the most valuable experience was the product design and prototyping process.

## What's next for Early Birds
We haven't finished all the pages, and there is no backend support besides user signup and login. The next step would be finishing up the pages and adding data and backend support.

## To run the code
1. Create an virtual environment and activate. Visit https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
2. Install all dependencies by ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run the server by ```python manage.py runserver``` and visit local host: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
